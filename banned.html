<h3>the skin you are using has been temporarily banned</h3>
<div class="narrow">
<p>the skin you are using to access this feed has been banned due to over activity.<br />
to reinstate use of this feed you must perform the following actions:
<ol>
	<li>fix your skin ini file:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Persona 3 and others</strong> - Find the UpdateRate for the moon feed in the skin's ini file and change that to 6000<br />
				OR you can download the updated Persona 3 ini files: <a href="/updated_skin_configs/persona_3/femc.ini">femc.ini</a>
				and <a href="/updated_skin_configs/persona_3/main.ini">main.ini</a></li>
			<li><strong>VClouds Weather 2</strong> - <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=vclouds+weather#/d2ylush">re-download from deviantart</a>,
				as the developer has made the appropriate changes</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>if you fixed your skin manually, search for 'www.iohelix.net'
		and replace all instances with 'iohelix.net' (removing the 'www.' part).</li>
	<li>also, search for 'moonlite.php' and replace all instances with
		'moonlite.xml'.</li>
	<li>once this is complete, <a href="/contact">contact me</a> and send me the
		name of the skin you are running as well as the IP addresses for any computers
		that have been blocked and I'll get you turned back on.</li>
</ol>
